  abstract = {{Designing, implementing, and operating a wireless sensor network
	involves a wide range of disciplines and many application-specific
	constraints. To make sense of and take advantage of these systems,
	a holistic approach is neededand this is precisely what Wireless
	Sensor Networks delivers.<br><br>Inside, two eminent researchers
	review the diverse technologies and techniques that interact in todays
	wireless sensor networks. At every step, they are guided by the high-level
	information-processing tasks that determine how these networks are
	architected and administered. Zhao and Guibas begin with the canonical
	problem of localizing and tracking moving objects, then systematically
	examine the many fundamental sensor network issues that spring from
	it, including network discovery, service establishment, data routing
	and aggregation, query processing, programming models, and system
	organization. The understanding gained as a resulthow different layers
	support the needs of different applications, and how a wireless sensor
	network should be built to optimize performance and economyis sure
	to endure as individual component technologies come and go.<br><br>Â·Written
	for practitioners, researchers, and students and relevant to all
	application areas, including environmental monitoring, industrial
	sensing and diagnostics, automotive and transportation, security
	and surveillance, military and battlefield uses, and large-scale
	infrastructural maintenance.<br>Â·Skillfully integrates the many
	disciplines at work in wireless sensor network design: signal processing
	and estimation, communication theory and protocols, distributed algorithms
	and databases, probabilistic reasoning, energy-aware computing, design
	methodologies, evaluation metrics, and more.<br>Â·Demonstrates how
	querying, data routing, and network self-organization can support
	high-level information-processing tasks.}},
