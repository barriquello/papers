Reviewer #2:

[X] Finally, graph for Figure 6 does not show any higher order statistics, only the average values. 
You should include standard deviation or confidence interval if different seeds were used in your simulations.
R: confidence intervals have been included

Reviewer #3:

[X] In section 4, low and high link density is mentioned, but it is not clear how to 
differentiate a low link density to a high link density and how it is modelled during the simulations.

R: The link density is modelled in the simulations by the radio range, 
the distance between neighboring nodes, and the constrained placement of nodes, 
as the nodes are not allowed to be in the regions enclosed by the streets.

[x] The last paragraph of the results section explain that "in a smart street lighting [network], 
thre may be some places where the link density is very low due to obstacles". 

Were obstacles simulated in the simulation environment? 
R: Yes. The obstacles have been simulated by the constrained node placement, as explained above.

How low is very low? 
R: Very low density is the density obtained when the radio range is set to the minimum value required to keep the network connected. 
The network is connected when, for any two nodes in the network, there is at least one path connecting them.

Generally, a street light will have visibility of some other nodes in the same street? 
R: Yes.
